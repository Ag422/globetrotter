      "Standing still is the fastest way to travel backwards, so one should Travel. It takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, 
      taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, 
      to embrace adventures as they come and to create new and meaningful experiences.
      <br><br>
      As we cross borders, and oceans, we gain true perspective. We learn to recognise and be grateful for all of the things we take for granted in our own lives, 
      and we also gain an appreciation and respect for how others live. Travel teaches us to be tolerant, flexible and open-minded, and most of all it makes us humble."
